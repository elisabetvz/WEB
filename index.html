    <a class="paragraph">I'm a political science graduate with a passion to influence society and embrace socio-cultural diversity through creativity. 
    I'm fascinated by the realms of design, fashion, film, photography and writing—and I have successfully gained a critical eye for these throughout the years. 
    My vision is to influence culture through innovative storytelling that emerges at the intersection of these passions. 
    I'm a determined, highly–intuitive and rigorous individual with the drive to produce excellent work in a timely and efficient way. 
    Overall, I believe that my broad range of knowledge and multi–disciplinary training can provide a critical–eye and insightful perspective, 
    allowing for the most effective solutions to create sustainable development.</a>
