      <p class="ss1">I'm a political science graduate with a passion to influence society and embrace socio-cultural diversity through creativity. 
        I'm fascinated by the realms of design, fashion, film, photography and creative writing—and I have successfully developed a critical eye for these throughout the years. 
        My vision is to influence culture through innovative storytelling that emerges at the intersection of these passions. 
        I'm a determined, highly–intuitive and rigorous individual with the drive to produce excellent work in a timely and efficient manner. 
        Overall, I believe that my broad range of knowledge and multi–disciplinary training can provide a critical–eye and insightful perspective, 
        ensuring the most effective solutions for sustainable project development and cutting–edge design.
        My interest in social psychology led me to focus my degree on cognitive approaches to decision making, which helped me acquire skills essential to my design practice. 
        Understanding how people make decisions opened up my mind to a plethora of design solutions. Combined with my training in sociology, I've been able to refine my work to best connect and represent society at an individual level.
