        <a class="heading-2">VISIONS OF LIFE</a>
        <a class="tableproject-info-grid; link-holder; paragraph">"A lot of thoughts went through my head, a million paradoxes of life colliding with my old-gone dreams. 
            I had dreamt about doing such things, writing for life, or designing art, but it had never been as real as this time. 
            These were actual dreams, my subconscious mind connecting to the spiritual realm. 
            In lapses of those visions at night, which I recorded in my notepad, I had glimpses of reality flashing through my eyes. 
            In every look, I was bombarded by all the expectations of society, but what was left bare were my own insecurities crashing into the wall I had built to limit myself, to be someone else. 
            I was so susceptible to the images of brilliance that seemed to emerge from the lives of everyone else, yet such glitter was mere falseness measured in an impostorâ€™s scale. 
            And so, deceived by my own naivety, I chained myself to the place of my own demise. My eyes had been blinded by the flashes of everyone else that I could no longer measure the value of anything. 
            I stripped myself of all value, at the place where I was about to sacrifice my identity. But, those dreams, those voices from my dreams, elevated gently yet conspicuously enough to be recognized by the blindest of hearts. 
            There I stood, awestruck at the wonder of life, eternally grateful at the gift of a second chance."</a>
