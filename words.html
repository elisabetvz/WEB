        <a class="tableproject-info-grid; link-holder; paragraph">"A lot of thoughts went through my head, a million paradoxes of life colliding with my old-gone dreams. 
            I had dreamt about doing such things, writing for life, or designing art, but it had never been as real as this time. 
            These were actual dreams, my subconscious mind connecting to the spiritual realm. 
            In lapses of those visions at night, which I recorded in my notepad, I had glimpses of reality flashing through my eyes. 
            In every look, I was bombarded by all the expectations of society, but what was left bare were my own insecurities crashing into the wall I had built to limit myself, to be someone else. 
            I was so susceptible to the images of brilliance that seemed to emerge from the lives of everyone else, yet such glitter was mere falseness measured in an impostorâ€™s scale. 
            And so, deceived by my own naivety, I chained myself to the place of my own demise. My eyes had been blinded by the flashes of strangers' highlights that I could no longer measure the value of anything. 
            I stripped myself of all value, at the place where I was about to sacrifice my identity. But, those dreams, those voices from my dreams, elevated gently yet conspicuously enough to be recognized by the blindest of hearts. 
            There I stood, awestruck at the wonder of life, eternally grateful at the gift of a second chance."</a>

            "We wonder, if the ashes of sunlight are the lost memories of our past, if the moon is the shadow of our hearts, if the ocean is filled with tears of romance. 
            More than the pain a knife could strike, or the fumes strife could air, is the chaos that my soul dwells in as each echo of my hope crumbles into ashes, as my memories of who I thought I was fade into the burning flames of that roaring planet. 
            In times when anguish intoxicates the air my lungs lack, my muscles tense in inner turmoil, fighting to find a way to survive. Memories and experiences, such a fragile fate, will they remain or fade away? I try to find myself, recollecting the pieces of earth that formed me, one empty space always takes all the fame. 
            Famous for its absence. Wanted for the lethal legacy of its disappearance. Whether losing pieces of myself in the journey of life is my habit, or those pieces ran away with all that left my life, is a mystery. 
            As that mystery stands, so does the mystery of my identity. In the ashes of dashing rays of light, a cry calls for my heart, that is where it all began, the search for my deepest loss: the loss of who I was."</a>
